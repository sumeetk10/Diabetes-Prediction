We have build a ML model to predict the person is diabetic or not by using various ML algorithm such as Random Forest, Support vector machine, KNN, Naivye Bayes, Logistic Regression.

<li> Below flowchar explaining entire process </li>
Take dataset(taken for www.kaggle.com/dataset , having data of 2000 patient ) --> preform data preprocessing --> apply various machine learning algorithms --> compare accuracy.
